Please change into the "./core" directory, it contains several scripts which can
be used to build ONS.
 - Users on systems which support an SH like shell like bash, zsh, csh, ... please
   execute the file "./build.sh".
 - Users on systems which support a WINDOWS BATCH like syntax please execute the
   file "./build.bat".
Other build methods are currently not supported. If you have a system where none
of these build scripts runs on, please notice us and we try to create additional
build scripts.

Please look into the documentation to get a detailed explanation on how these scripts
work and how to modify their behaviour and adjust them to your needs.
