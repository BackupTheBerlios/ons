           Korean.
    4690 - Review and Recommendations for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).
 - IDNA can be used totally independent from DNS. Therefore, we exspect the user to
   use an UI library which converts UTF-8 into IDN strings before passing them to
   the resolver. The resolver can work with IDN strings the same way as with normal
   ASCII strings.

DDDS Extension (DDDS):
 - RFCs:
    3401 - Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS).
         - Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS.
    3402 - Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS).
         - Part Two: The Algorithm.
    3403 - Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS).
         - Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database.
    3404 - Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS).
         - Part Four: The Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Resolution Application.
    3405 - Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS).
         - Part Five: URI.ARPA Assignment Procedures.
    3761 - The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Dynamic Delegation
           Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM).
    3762 - Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) Service Registration for H.323.

           Addresses-of-Record.
    3958 - Domain-Based Application Service Location Using SRV RRs and the Dynamic
           Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS).
    4848 - Domain-Based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic
           Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS).
 - DDDS is a nice standard which can easily be integrated into the resolver. Moreover,
   it can even be used with the current resolver if you parse the rdata yourself.
   However, I have never heard that DDDS is really used and therefore, we haven't
   implemented it yet.

Unsupported Techniques (UNSUPP TECH):
 - RFCs:
    1535 - Shows a security problem with widely deployed DNS software and non rooted
           FQDNs.
         - We do not support the obsolete interface of local search trees and non
           rootet FQDNs. If you need this functionality, we recommend to add this
           into the IDN library you use. We only provide a resolution in the DNS,
           not any domain transformation and corrections.
    2540 - Detached Domain Name System (DNS) Information.
         - Shows how to save DNS information in a binary form or a text form detached
           from the Domain Name System. We provide the information attached to the
           DNS, the user has to care for this RFC if he wants to distribute it
           detached from the DNS.
    1995 - Incremental zone transfer protocol (IXFR).
         - A resolver does not need to know AXFR or IXFR because it does not manage
           a zone and therefore cannot handle zone transfers.
    1996 - DNS NOTIFY mechanism for prompt notification of zone changes.
         - Only master servers can send this to slave servers. A resolver is never a
           server, thus, we do not need this.
    3123 - A DNS RR Type for Lists of Address Prefixes (APL RR).
         - Experimental RR which provides CIDR information for subnets. Who uses such
           information? Denied!
    4701 - A DNS Resource Record (RR) for Encoding Dynamic Host Configuration
           Protocol (DHCP) Information (DHCID RR).
         - This RR is used by the DHCP protocol and can be resolved by this resolver.
           However, parsing the rdata has to be done by the DHCP application. This is
           not in the scope of an resolver, but in the scope of DHCP software.
    3646 - DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
           for IPv6.
         - Same reason as 4701.
    5158 - 6to4 Reverse DNS Delegation Specification.
         - Allows to push 6to4 information into a zone file of a server.
           Only informational, the same effect can be achieved with the supported
           UPDATE command or other mechanisms.
    2163 - Using the internet DNS to distribute MIXER conformant global address
           mapping (MCGAM).
         - Unused and historic RR type.

Unsupported Informational RFCs (UNSUPP INFO):
 - RFCs:
    1123 - Defines which actions must be supported by internet hosts including
           the DNS.
         - This RFC does not define any technical details and tells only what an
           host in the internet should support. We implement the DNS protocol
           exactly, therefore, we always conform to this protocol.
    1591 - Domain name system structure and delegation.
         - We are not interested in information which top-level domains exist and
           how to administrate them. It has nothing to do with the technical details.
    1713 - Domain name system debug facilities and software.
         - This RFC is an advert for DNS debug software. Sorry dudes, but adverts suck.
    1912 - Common DNS operational and configuration errors.
         - Only of interest for server administrators. We only implement a resolver!
           Mentions only one bug in resolvers which says, that the user input should
           be checked that it is not already an IP. This is hopefully done by the
           user input library, not by us. We allow to resolve every name.
    4367 - What's in a Name: False Assumptions about DNS Names.
         - Lists some false assumptions what users/clients/servers expect behind a name
           by only evaluating the name. This is not in the scope of a resolver.
    5358 - Preventing Use of Recursive Nameservers in Reflector Attacks
         - Shows how reflector-attacks work and suggest to stop providing recursive
           services to everyone and add IP access based authorization.
         - Not part of a resolver.
    1401 - Shows 3 letters between IAB and DISA trying to clarify about the future
           domain name system.
         - No technical details. Only historical information.
    2606 - Reserved Top Level DNS Names.
         - We recognize this RFC in our examples, but we do not prevent the resolution
           of the domains mentioned here. This should be checked by the input library.
    2826 - Technical comment on the unique of the DNS root.
         - We support only one DNS root. However, there is no technical stuff in this
           RFC, therefore, we can safely ignore it.
    3467 - Role of the Domain Name System (DNS).
         - Mentions that the DNS should not be overloaded and only be used for the stuff
           it is intended for. Would give a great blog entry but not usefull for a
           resolver implementation.
    4892 - Requirements for a Mechanism Identifying a Name Server Instance.
         - Important for new standards. It does not declare a standard itself, but lists
           facts which have to be considered in possible new standards.
    3681 - Delegation of E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA.
         - 6bone is no longer active.
    3901 - DNS IPv6 Transport Operational Guidelines.
         - Shows the problem when DNS is served only by IPv6 and an IPv4 resolver cannot
           access it or vice versa. Contains only information for server administrators.
    4339 - IPv6 Host Configuration of DNS Server Information Approaches.
           "Therefore, the objective of this document is to help the audience
            select the approaches suitable for IPv6 host configuration of
            recursive DNS servers."
           Contains no technical information.
    5006 - IPv6 Router Advertisement Option for DNS Configuration.
         - Allows routers to send IPv6 packets with information about recursive nameservers.
           Does not extend the DNS standard.
    881 - Outlines a plan for domain names in the ARPA-NET.
    897 - Implementation schedule of the DNS in the internet.
    921 - Revision of the RFCs 881/897.
    952 - Revised definition of the DoD hosts.txt on SRI-NIC.
    1032 - Domain registration guideline at NIC (DDN).
         - Should be used in conjunction with RFC 920.
    1033 - Shows Domain admins how to maintain their part in the DNS.
    1611/1612 - Server portion of Management Information Base (MIB) with network
           management protocols.
         - Both marked as historic.
    1982 - Serial number arithmetics.
         - Shows how DNS server admins should increase their SOA serial numbers.
    2182 - Selection and operation of secondary dns servers.
         - Information for people running name servers.
    2219 - Use of DNS aliases for several services.
         - eg., declaration of the "www" abbreviation.
         - Information for users and name server runners, not for resolvers.
    2870 - Root Name Server Operational Requirements.
         - Information for name server admins.
    2317 - Classless in-addr.arpa delegation.
         - Information for admins to allow subnet delegation.
    3071 - Reflections on the DNS, RFC 1591, and Categories of Domains.
         - Only informational about ICANN's role as root owner.
    3258 - Distributing Authoritative Name Servers via Shared Unicast Addresses.
         - Information for domain name server admins.
    4027 - Domain Name System Media Types.
         - Defines media-types for dns. Only usefull for detached information.
    4183 - A Suggested Scheme for DNS Resolution of Networks and Gateways.
         - same reason as 2317
    4185 - National and Local Characters for DNS Top Level Domain (TLD) Names.
         - Administrational information.


Unsupported Extensions to the user interface (UNSUPP UI):
 - RFCs:
    1101 - Allows to map class A/B/C networks to an domain name.
         - Works the same way as a single ip but omits the zero parts of the ip.
         - The current core allows the resolution of this type but the UI does not
           implement it, yet, because it is only rarely used.
    1383 - Some ideas in routing through DNS and some other discussions.
         - This RFC uses TXT records to store routing information in the DNS. Our
           core handles TXT records correctly, however, the UI does not provide an
           interface for that.
           This technique is not used in the internet. The RFC should be marked
           obsolete.
    1183 - new RRs: AFS Data Base location RR, Responsible Person RR,
           X25 RR, ISDN RR, Route Through RR.
         - These RRs can be resolved by the core, but an explicit API is not supported,
           because the RFC is experimental and not widely used. It probably will become
           obsolete in future.

         - The RR can be retrieved, but is not directly supported because it is not
           widely used in the internet and will probably become obsolete.

           is not encoded and has to be handled by the user.
