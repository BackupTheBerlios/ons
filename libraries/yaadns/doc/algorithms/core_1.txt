This algorithm implements the DNS protocol explained in the RFCs:
 - 1034
 - 1035

The other core files highly depend on this file. They extend or
change the algorithm mentioned here. The highest core file is always
the algorithm which is implemented in the resolver.

However, the RFCs are highly separated into "Standards" and
"proposed Standards" or lower. This file implements all DNS related
RFCs which are currently a STANDARD!
Though, the internet does really *NOT* use this standard but many
extensions which were made to it.

############### PINBOARD ###############

By convention, domain names can be stored with arbitrary case, but
domain name comparisons for all present domain functions are done in a
case-insensitive manner, assuming an ASCII character set, and a high
order zero bit.  This means that you are free to create a node with
label "A" or a node with label "a", but not both as brothers; you could
refer to either using "a" or "A".

Each node has a set of resource information, which may be empty.

The order of RRs in a set is not significant, and need
not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other parts of the DNS.

If a CNAME RR is present at a node, no other data should be
present; this ensures that the data for a canonical name and its aliases
cannot be different.  This rule also insures that a cached CNAME can be
used without checking with an authoritative server for other RR types.

The one exception to this rule is that queries which match the CNAME
type are not restarted.

The most important field in the header is a four bit field called an
opcode which separates different queries.  Of the possible 16 values,
one (standard query) is part of the official protocol, two (inverse
query and status query) are options, one (completion) is obsolete, and
the rest are unassigned.

Hence responses to QCLASS=* queries can never be authoritative.

Therefore, the RRs returned in inverse queries should never be cached.

3.8. Status queries (Experimental)
To be defined.

3.9. Completion queries (Obsolete)
The optional completion services described in RFCs 882 and 883 have been
deleted.

The class partition is simple.  The database for any class is organized,
delegated, and maintained separately from all other classes.  Since, by
convention, the name spaces are the same for all classes, the separate
classes can be thought of as an array of parallel namespace trees.

The authoritative data for a zone is simply all of the RRs attached to
all of the nodes from the top node of the zone down to leaf nodes or
nodes above cuts around the bottom edge of the zone.

Though logically part of the authoritative data, the RRs that describe
the top node of the zone are especially important to the zone's
management.  These RRs are of two types: name server RRs that list, one
per RR, all of the servers for the zone, and a single SOA RR that
describes zone management parameters.

The RRs that describe cuts around the bottom of the zone are NS RRs that
name the servers for the subzones.  Since the cuts are between nodes,
these RRs are NOT part of the authoritative data of the zone, and should
be exactly the same as the corresponding RRs in the top node of the
subzone.  Since name servers are always associated with zone boundaries,
NS RRs are only found at nodes which are the top node of some zone.  In
the data that makes up a zone, NS RRs are found at the top node of the
zone (and are authoritative) and at cuts around the bottom of the zone
(where they are not authoritative), but never in between.

The recursion available, or RA bit, is set or cleared by a
name server in all responses.  The bit is true if the name
server is willing to provide recursive service for the client,
regardless of whether the client requested recursive service.
That is, RA signals availability rather than use.

the client can verify
that recursive mode was used by checking that both RA and RD are set in
the reply.  Note that the name server should never perform recursive
service unless asked via RD, since this interferes with trouble shooting
of name servers and their databases.

If recursive service is requested and available, the recursive response
to a query will be one of the following:
   - The answer to the query, possibly preface by one or more CNAME
     RRs that specify aliases encountered on the way to an answer.
   - A name error indicating that the name does not exist.  This
     may include CNAME RRs that indicate that the original query
     name was an alias for a name which does not exist.
   - A temporary error indication.
If recursive service is not requested or is not available, the non-
recursive response will be one of the following:
   - An authoritative name error indicating that the name does not
     exist.
   - A temporary error indication.
   - Some combination of:
     RRs that answer the question, together with an indication
     whether the data comes from a zone or is cached.
     A referral to name servers which have zones which are closer
     ancestors to the name than the server sending the reply.
   - RRs that the name server thinks will prove useful to the
     requester.

A * label appearing in a query name has no special effect, but can be
used to test for wildcards in an authoritative zone; such a query is the
only way to get a response containing RRs with an owner name with * in
it.  The result of such a query should not be cached.

"*.<anydomain>"

Similarly, a resolver can make a query
with a QTYPE which matches multiple types, and cache the fact that some
of the types are not present.
