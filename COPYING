# Some explanations of public domain.
#

First, if your country does not support public domain, don't hesitate to contact
us. We will do our best to release ONS with a license you want.

Now about public domain. You are allowed to use everything dedicated to the
public domain the way you want. Don't be confused by the copyrights on top of
each file, you are allowed to remove them or change them.
Though, we would be glad if you honour our work on a decent way.
