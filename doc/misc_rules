Header inclusion:
- First "machine.h" if it is a source file, and only if it really is.
- Then "sundry.h".
- Then in headers you check for "extern-c" and "double inclusion" probably
  with SUNDRY macros.
- Then include all other ONS headers you depend on.
- Then all ISO-C headers.
- And as last step include operating system headers if required.

Function parameters:
- If the function has two parameters, the first is the source, the second the
  target.
- If the function has more than 2 parameters, then the first is the target that
  we operate on and then all sources, each followed by parameters affecting only
  this source, and last parameters which are general or affect all sources.
- If we operate on an object and we have NO source but another parameter, then
  the target (the object) is the first parameter followed by the other param.
